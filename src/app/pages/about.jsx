        <p>
          First and foremost, I am passionately curious. I love organizing
          things and creating experiences that work for both businesses and
          users. I enjoy working through data, information, scenarios, and
          numbers to create impactful digital products. I educate, refine and
          drive myself to be a better person and I am constantly learning
          because I never settle. I love reading, personal development,
          problem-solving, coaching, teaching & helping others to grow, playing
          video games, and a bunch of other stuff. I enjoy meeting new people
          and hearing new perspectives. Reach out if you want to talk to me, I
          would love to get in touch!
